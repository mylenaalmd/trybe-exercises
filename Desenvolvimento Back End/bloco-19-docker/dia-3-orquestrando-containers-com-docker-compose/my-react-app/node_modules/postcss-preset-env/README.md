[PostCSS Preset Env] lets you convert modern CSS into something most browsers
can understand, determining the polyfills you need based on your targeted
browsers or runtime environments.

## Quick start

[PostCSS Preset Env] is a [PostCSS] plugin.<br>
If you are already using [PostCSS] to build your CSS, you can simply add [PostCSS Preset Env] to your configuration.

- Install `postcss-preset-env` from npm.
- Add `postcss-preset-env` to your configuration:

```js
const postcssPresetEnv = require('postcss-preset-env');

const yourConfig = {
	plugins: [
		postcssPresetEnv(/* pluginOptions */)
	]
}
```

## How does it work?

[PostCSS Preset Env] is a Plugin Pack for [PostCSS]. It leverages the list of the features we keep an eye from [CSSDB][cssdb] and applies plugins, so you can use those new features without having to worry about browser support.

CSSDB exposes the browser support that each feature has which can come from [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/css-all) or from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/all) (through [mdn/browser-compat-data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data)).

By providing a list of browser targets for your project, plugins that aren't needed will be skipped. Over time your targets might change and by updating the settings your CSS bundle will only ever contain the needed fallbacks.

What [PostCSS Preset Env] does is to take the support data that comes from MDN and Can I Use and determine from a [browserlist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) whether those transformations are needed. It also packs [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) within and shares the list with it, so prefixes are only applied when you're going to need them given your browser support list.

### Glossary:

* **Browser list option**: [Browserlist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) is a package that gives you a list of browsers for a given query. For example, `chrome < 42` will give you a list of every Chrome version that has been released up to, but not including, 42.
* **Browser support stats**: Features get introduced on browsers at certain versions. They're often visible on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/). Comparing these stats with the needed _support_ for your project tells you if it's safe to use a feature or not.
* **CSS Feature**: A CSS feature is often part of some spec that enables a specific feature. For example, `hwb` functional notation lets you express a given color according to its hue, whiteness, and blackness. This is part of the CSS Color 4 Spec.
* **CSS Spec**: A Spec is a document that collects new features, what problems are they trying to solve and how it's intended to be solved (generally). This is usually an evolving document that goes over lengthy discussions between several people from different companies.
* **Plugin**: A plugin is package that's intended (usually) to enable a new CSS Feature by leveraging PostCSS. This doesn't need to be part of any spec. An example of the latter is [PostCSS Mixins](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-mixins), a concept that existed on Less or Sass, but it's not part of any spec. This plugin plack **only** packs plugins that enable features acknowledged by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) which will then be implemented by browsers later.
* **Polyfill**: A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it. A polyfill _should_ be indistinguishable from the native behaviour.

Here's a quick example of the syntax you can leverage by using [PostCSS Preset Env].

```pcss
@custom-media --viewport-medium (width <= 50rem);
@custom-selector :--heading h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6;

:root {
  --mainColor: #12345678;
}

body {
  color: var(--mainColor);
  font-family: system-ui;
  overflow-wrap: break-word;
}

:--heading {
  background-image: image-set(url(img/heading.png) 1x, url(img/heading@2x.png) 2x);

  @media (--viewport-medium) {
    margin-block: 0;
  }
}

a {
  color: rgb(0 0 100% / 90%);

  &:hover {
    color: rebeccapurple;
  }
}

/* becomes */

:root {
  --mainColor: rgba(18, 52, 86, 0.47059);
